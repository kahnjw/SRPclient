SRPclient
=========

This is a client implementation of the sliding window protocol. This
application reliably transfers files over an unreliable connection using the C
sockets API and other low level functionality. I wrote this code during my
undergraduate days for a network systems class, so no judgement allowed :)

To make the binary, run:

```sh
$ make binary
```

You will see several compiler warnings, again, college days.
